Links the essential/desirable competencies for a specific job with an individual’s competency potential. Provides an overall Match (or fit) Score useful in ranking/sorting candidates for selection\nand/or development (e.g. Talent Audit). It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development needs/limitations.\nThe extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions\nto enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have\ndemonstrated critical job behaviours.\n\nThe PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and\ndevelopment situations. It is valuable for identifying an individual's overall fit as well as likely areas of\nstrength and weakness relative to their behaviour at work.\n\nIn a selection context, this information can be used: For making interviewers aware of the areas that may need further probing.
